# Data Structures and Algorithms

I have implemented some of the Data Structures and Algorithms as described in the book Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS, 3rd ed), for familiarising myself with programming and computation.

### Data Structures
- Stack
- Queue
- Linked List
- Heap
- Hash Table
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Priority Queue
- Graph 

### Algorithms
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Breadth-first Search
- Depth-first Search
- Dijkstra's Shortest Path (not optimal)
